description: a maze crawler built with WebGL.

This is an extension of my project on Computer Graphics Practicum. Shiyu Wang, Yuyan Tang and I worked together on this project.

#### Instructions
Press `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` to move around.

Press `M` to update the configuration of the maze crawler.

You can update _FOV(field of view)_, _eye height_ and _maze map_ here.

In _maze map_, `#` represents a wall and `.` represents floor.

#### TODO

- [x] Implement skybox in background
- [ ] Use more complex textures from [openGameArt](https://opengameart.org/)(textures with bumping effect)
- [ ] Increase playability of this maze crawler

P.S: the markdown I am using does not support checkbox, so this looks a little bit clumsy here.
