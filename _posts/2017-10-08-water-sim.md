This is an extension of my project on Computer Graphics Practicum at Cornell University. Shiyu Wang, Alex Chen, Weiyu Wang and I worked together on this project.

#### Instructions
Press `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` to rotate camera.

You can update the configuration with the panel on the right.

Since the textures are very large, it might take a few seconds to load the content.

#### Known Issue
The rendering is very slow on Mac (~ 2 FPS, so it is not fluent at all), but more than 10 FPS on PC. It could be due to different hardware implementation, so some of our operation cause the bottleneck on Mac.
