Welcome to Zili's personal website!! I created this site to share some of my interesting projects and my thoughts. I post some of my projects to this site and record my thoughts in learning. Please feel free to check in from time to time.

Hi! I am Zili. I am recent master graduate from Information Science at Cornell University. I am interested in machine learning, computer graphics and web development. Since I am a curious person, my interest list might keep growing rapidly! Feel free to contact me with my contact info in my resume if you are hiring!
[This]({{ site.url }}/assets/Zili_Resume.pdf) is my resume.
